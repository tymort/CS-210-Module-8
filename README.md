# CS-210-Module-8

The goal of this project was to prompt a user for certain important financial information such as the principal, monthly pasyment, time, and interest in order to showcase how their money would grow. It would print out two tables that compared the amount with monthly deposits and without deposits.
----
I feel like my table formatting was done relatively well considering I tried to shy away from more advanced formatting techniques. I tried to use only basic for loops and text elements in order to create a nice end user format which I believe turnedout nice.
----
My code could better be enhanced by streamlining the objects and methods. While the use of methods does help for security, I feel like some of my elements were repetitive and could be trimmed down using better methods. I also feel like the ability to export the charts to a text file for printing would be a useful feature for the user so that they could have a physical reminder of their savings.
----
One of the most challenging parts of my code was formatting the spaces between my columns. I was able to find many resources on w3schools and stackoverflow that showed me how to use the setw method in c++. However, since I wanted to use only more basic formatting, I was also able to find explanations of how exactly the \t character worked and so I was able to find a happy balance that resulted in even columns.
----
The usage of classes and header files will be applicable to all future projects and help me to modularize and secure my projects. It will also help to ensure that my code meets all aspects of the assignment as it must match the methods present in the header file to compile.
----
I made this program maintainable through the use of thorough commenting and industry standard best practices. I used easy to understand variable names and commented out the functions of each aspect. I made my thoughts as a programmer very clear in these many comments. I also eliminated the use of any magic numbers or variables in my code. I also used many methods and classes which make it easy to adapt this to other programs through inheritance and method calling.
